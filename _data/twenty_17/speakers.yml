  description: Edwin R. Hancock (FREng) holds a BSc degree in physics (1977), a PhD degree in high-energy physics (1981) and a D.Sc. degree (2008) from the University of Durham, and a doctorate Honoris Causa from the University of Alicante in 2015. From 1981-1991 he worked as a researcher in the fields of high-energy nuclear physics and pattern recognition at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory (now the Central Research Laboratory of the Research Councils). During this period,  he worked on high energy physics experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelarator Center (SLAC) providing the first measurements of charmed particle lifetimes. He also held adjunct teaching posts at the University of Surrey and the Open University. In 1991, he moved to the University of York as a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science, where he has held a chair in Computer Vision since 1998. He lead a group of some 25 faculty, research staff, and PhD students working in the areas of computer vision and pattern recognition. His main research interests are in the use of optimization and probabilistic methods for high and intermediate level vision. He is also interested in the methodology of structural and statistical and pattern recognition. He is currently working on graph matching, shape-from-X, image databases, and statistical learning theory. His work has found applications in areas such as radar terrain analysis, seismic section analysis, remote sensing, and medical imaging. He has published more than 200 journal papers and 650 refereed conference publications. He was awarded the Pattern Recognition Society medal in 1991 and an outstanding paper award in 1997 by the journal Pattern Recognition. He has also received best paper prizes at CAIP 2001, ACCV 2002, ICPR 2006,  BMVC 2007 and ICIAP in 2009 and 2015. In 2009 he was awarded a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award. In 1998, he became a fellow of the International Association for Pattern Recognition. He is also a fellow of the Institute of Physics, the Institute of Engineering and Technology, and the British Computer Society. In 2016 he became a fellow of the IEEE and was named  Distinguished Fellow by the British Machine Vision Association. He was elected a Fellow of Royal Academy of Engineering in 2021. In 2018 he received the Pierre Devijver Award from the IAPR. He is currently Editor-in-Chief of the journal Pattern Recognition, and was founding Editor-in-Chief of IET Computer Vision from 2006 until 2012.  He has also been a member of the editorial boards of the journals IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, Computer Vision and Image Understanding, Image and Vision Computing, and the International Journal of Complex Networks. He has been Conference Chair for BMVC in 1994 and  Programme Chair in 2016, Track Chair for ICPR in  2004 and 2016 and Area Chair at ECCV 2006 and CVPR in  2008 and 2014, and in 1997 established the EMMCVPR workshop series. He was  a Governing Board Member of the IAPR from 2006 to 2016, and was Second Vice President of the Association (2016-2018). He is an IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Visitor 2021-2023.

  topic: AI Hardware and Real-world AI
  description: Andrew Fitzgibbon (FREng) is a Distinguished Engineer at Graphcore, working on the future of computing hardware and programming for AI and numerical computing. He is best known for his work on 3D vision. He was a core contributor to the Emmy-award-winning 3D camera tracker “boujou”, having co-founded the company “2d3”, with Andrew Zisserman, Julian Morris, and Nick Bolton; at Microsoft, he introduced massive synthetic training data for Kinect for Xbox 360; and was science lead on the real-time hand tracking in Microsoft's HoloLens. His research interests are broad, spanning computer vision, graphics, machine learning, neuroscience, and most recently programming languages. He has published numerous highly-cited papers, and received many awards for his work, including ten “best paper” prizes at various venues, the Silver medal of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and the BCS Roger Needham award. He is a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, the British Computer Society, and the International Association for Pattern Recognition. Before joining Graphcore in 2022, he spent 15 years at Microsoft, and before then, he was a Royal Society University Research Fellow at Oxford University, having previously studied at Edinburgh University, Heriot-Watt University, and University College, Cork.

    AI is fast becoming a significant consumer of the world’s computational power, so it is crucial to use that power wisely and efficiently.
    Our approaches to doing so must span all levels of the research stack:
      Fundamental theoretical understanding of machine learning models and optimizers;
      Simple translation of those models to efficient code;
      Efficient layout at the transistor level of floating-point multipliers and RAM. 
    I will talk about projects, such as real-time computer vision on the Microsoft HoloLens HPU (about 3.5 GFLOPS), which required extreme efficiency in both objective and gradient computations, and how this relates to the training of massive AI models on Graphcore’s IPU (about 350 TFLOPS).
    Key to this work is how we empower programmers to communicate effectively with such hardware, and how we design frameworks and languages to ensure we can put theory into practice. 
    So this talk contains aspects of: mathematical optimization, automatic differentiation, programming languages, and silicon design.   Despite this range of topics, the plan is for it to be accessible and useful to anyone who loves computers.

  description: Professor Ivan Tyukin is an expert in the mathematical foundations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and learning systems, Machine Learning, mathematical modelling, adaptive systems, inverse problems with nonconvex and nonlinear parameterization, data analytics, and computer vision at King's College London. Professor Tyukin has been awarded a prestigious Turing AI Acceleration Fellowship to lead innovative and creative AI research with transformative impact. He is a member of the IFAC Technical Committee on Adaptive and Learning Systems, an Editor of Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulations, and is a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group on AI's data governance task force which examines the economic, social, and ethical implications of AI. He has a broad network of academic and industrial collaborators includes strategic UK sectors such as public safety and security, health technologies, space and Earth Observation, and manufacturing. Professor Tyukin’s recent work focuses on creating a theory and practice for developing AI systems that are provably robust, resilient, certifiable, trustworthy, human-centric and data-driven. The theory will enable the creation of new-generation AI systems which are certifiably stable, secure, adaptive and maintainable. These systems will be prepared to handle the challenges of adversarial attacks and data inconsistences, uncertainties, and bias inherent within any empirical data. This will enable new gold standard methods and tools in tasks that are currently heavily reliant upon non-deterministic human input to have long-term transformation.
